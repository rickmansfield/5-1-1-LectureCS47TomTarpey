## NOTE 
We will have the questions thread in slack to be the source of truth for questions, so all questions will be read from there.

### What this will mean for the learner.

- your mics should be muted at all times in zoom
- you can type questions in to the questions thread to be read by the instructor
- the instructor will only answer relevant (on topic) questions in class
- you will be able to get off topic or long answer questions answered a-sync (via the thread after class)
- you will also be able to come to office hours to get more in depth answers
- if the instructor does not answer a specific question in the slack questions thread (it was deemed either off topic, a repeat of a previous question, or one more suited to office hours.

## Attendance Codes
- The attendance codes shall be shared during breaks in the GP.
- A copy of the attendance code shall be at the top of the lessons Colab Notebook for reference.
